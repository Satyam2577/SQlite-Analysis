# SQlite-Analysis

# E-commerce SQL Dashboard

This is a simple personal project where I built an interactive dashboard using SQL and Streamlit. The data simulates an e-commerce platform with customers and orders.

## 💡 What It Does
- Loads customer and order data into an SQLite database
- Runs SQL queries to analyze revenue, top customers, and country-wise orders
- Visualizes results in a clean dashboard using Streamlit

## 📊 Features
- Total Revenue (metric display)
- Orders by Country (bar chart)
- Top 5 Customers by Spending (table)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install the dependencies:
   pip install pandas streamlit matplotlib

2.Run the dashboard:
  streamlit run ecommerce_dashboard.py
